  1. Compare Offsets (Result - Filename)
  2. Compare Offsets MD5 (MD5 Hash - Filename)
  3. Double Offsets Comparison (Result 1 - Result 2 - Filename)
  4. Dynamic Offset MD5 Calculation (Size - MD5 - Filename)

Statistical Analysis
  5. Compare Offsets Entropy (log2(256)) (Entropy - Filename)
  6. Compare Entropy (log2(256)) (Entropy - Filename)
  7. Compare Statistics (00 Count % / FF Count % - Filename)

Hash/Other Analysis
  8. Obtain File MD5s (MD5 Hash - Filename)
  9. Obtain File SHA1s (SHA1 Hash - Filename)
  10. Obtain MIME Types (MIME - Filename)
